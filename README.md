We where given the assignment of making a quiz-like project with React and the freedom to consume whichever api we would like to get the data. The first that came to my mind was the pokeAPI, mainly becouse on how specific you can get with the data they provide!

I instantly remember about the days I used to watch Pokemon and a "WHO IS THAT POKEMON" flashback visited my mind.

I felt instantly inspiried to replicate this, and even though there are multiple things I would like to add, Im calling this project a success because:

## The takes:

- Strengthened my component-based mentality using Reacts functional components.
- Improved way of handling some new features (to me) like state-lifting.
- Developed my probmem-solving skills.

## What the game can do:

- Player has a total of 3 lives. If your option is not correct you loose a life. At 0 it is game over and you are given the option to restart.

- Game keeps track of a score. If your option is succesfull, you get 50 points.

- Every round a random Pokemon is fetched from the total pool of 898 Pokemons.

## What I would like to implement to the game still:

- A difficulty mode. The more difficult the game, the more options you have to pick between.

- A pokemon sound option.

- A way to select which gen you want the pokemons to be fetched from, but the less pokemons the less the score it gives.

## Conclusion

Had a lot of fun working on this one, and sure learned a ton!
